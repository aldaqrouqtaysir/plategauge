# Pillow resampling attribution

`pillowResize.ts` is a new TypeScript implementation of the opaque 8-bit RGB bicubic resampling behavior described by Pillow 12.3.0's [`src/libImaging/Resample.c`](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.3.0/src/libImaging/Resample.c), consulted 22 September 2026, and the locally installed `PIL/Image.py` `Image.resize` wrapper. Relevant behavior: the `bicubic_filter`, `precompute_coeffs`, `normalize_coeffs_8bpc`, RGB horizontal/vertical passes, and pass ordering. The wrapper resizes vertically first when source height exceeds 100 times source width and height is being reduced; all other nonidentity cases use horizontal then vertical. The upstream [license](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.3.0/LICENSE) is MIT-CMU; its notice is reproduced below.

Changes from the upstream C implementation: typed opaque RGBA interface; explicit runtime validation; fixed image/workspace/work limits; JavaScript arithmetic instead of C lookup tables; private input snapshots and intermediate zeroization; bounded asynchronous yielding and cancellation; no other resampling filters, image modes, boxes, file decoders, or image metadata processing. This module is not endorsed by Pillow's authors. It does not modify the frozen PlateGauge v1 preprocessing implementation.
